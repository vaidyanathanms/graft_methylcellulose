Generates trajectory files

Use in the following order for generic semiflexible cases: in.init, in.run1, in.run2, in.prod
For MC_cases use: in.init, in.mc_run1, in.mc_run2, in.prod

Requires input datafile and the name needs to be inserted in in.init
Either generate the input interactions file manually or use the FORTRAN codes supplied.
